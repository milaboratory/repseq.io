Built-in library upgraded to 1.5, many genes updated / added (see library changelog for modifications)
Major refactoring of `fromPaddedFasta` action, separate action for plain fasta import (see `fromFasta`). Convenient pipeline for importing fasta files (see README)
Added GeneFeature#isAlignmentAttached() method
minor: Fix for incorrect negative value interpretation in `fromPaddedFasta` action
