RepSeqIO 1.2.10 (24 Jul 2017)
========================

-- Update to MiLib 1.8.1


RepSeqIO 1.2.9 (24 Jul 2017)
========================



RepSeqIO 1.2.8 ( 7 Jun 2017)
========================

-- Artificial repertoire generator (user defined model, built-in model for TRB rearengements from 
   *Murugan et al., 2012*; use model name `murugan`)
-- Infrastructure for artificial repretoire generation + possible format for description of V(D)J 
   rearengements (`*.jclns`)
-- Fixed method `VDJGene#getFamilyName`
-- Added Chains#parse method
-- Two implementations for `ReferencePoints` (normal and extended - used in artificial `GClone`s)
-- `isComplete()` method for `VDJGene`
-- Two convenient `getGenes` method variants for `VDJCLibrary`
-- Information about build host now is added to output binary jar file


RepSeqIO 1.2.7 ( 2 Mar 2017)
========================

-- New action `tsv` to export library content to tab-delimited table (pull-request from @bbimber)
-- Added more validations for `debug` action (pull-request from @bbimber)
-- Warning messages for `inferPoints` action in case the inferred point doesn't match point from 
   target library (pull-request from @bbimber)
-- Fixed bug in `SequencePartitioning`, bug affected results of getRelativeRange for zero-length 
   gene features
-- (alpha) Support for notes in the library files
-- (alpha) Tags for individual genes


RepSeqIO 1.2.6 ( 4 Feb 2017)
========================

-- Additional modification to `io.repseq.core.GeneFeature#intersection`. Split into two methods 
   `intersection` and `intersectionStrict`.
-- `getSafe()` method added to VDJCGene class


RepSeqIO 1.2.5 (30 Jan 2017)
========================

-- Added alias anchor point `DRegionTrimmed` = `DCDR3Part`
-- Fix for wrong behaviour of `io.repseq.core.GeneFeature#intersection` for gene features with two 
   P segments (like D gene with both right and left P segment)
-- minor: NPE in getRelativeRange with PSergments fixed


RepSeqIO 1.2.4 (26 Dec 2016)
========================

-- Explicit warning messages in `debug` action (thanks to @bbimber).
-- New checks in `debug` action (thanks to @bbimber): intron splice site validation, etc...
-- Added `getTranslationParameters(...)` in `SequencePartitioning`, unified way to infer 
   translation frame for given gene feature
-- Added `getCodingFeature` in `GeneFeature`, extracts coding sub-feature from given gene feature
-- Internal library updated to v1.2 (added rat reference, fix for human TRAJ55 pseudogene)
-- minor: Fix for space in io.repseq.core.GeneFeature#encode


RepSeqIO 1.2.3 ( 7 Dec 2016)
========================

-- Support for Linux `free` version 3.3.10 in `repseqio` wrapper script (now RepSeq.io runs on 
   Centos 7.2, Ubuntu 16.04.1)


RepSeqIO 1.2.2 ( 8 Nov 2016)
========================

-- Fixes IO exception if library search folder not exists
-- `loadAllLibraries` method in `VDJCLibraryRegistry`
-- `LibraryNameListProvider` interface for library resolvers
-- Reverse species name search in `VDJCLibraryRegistry`
-- Built-in library updated to v1.1 (fixed human IGHV4-61 and IGLC7, IGLC3)
-- NCBI sequence resolver now works over https
-- Additional sequence id extractor for new NCBI naming convention


RepSeqIO 1.2.1 ( 7 Oct 2016)
========================

-- Fixes bug when FolderResolver fails to resolve partial library name for files without .gz
-- Fixes bug not allowing to inferPoints using built-in library


RepSeqIO 1.2.0 (13 Sep 2016)
========================



RepSeqIO 1.1.0 (19 Aug 2016)
========================



RepSeqIO 1.0.0 (18 Jul 2016)
========================

-- First version
